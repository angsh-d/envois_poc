## Instructions

Generate a formal safety summary narrative suitable for regulatory submission (FDA PMA, CE Mark Technical File) that includes:

### 1. Safety Overview (1 paragraph)
- State the overall safety profile
- Reference the patient population and follow-up period
- Summarize the number of adverse events

### 2. Adverse Event Analysis (2-3 paragraphs)
- Detail each adverse event category
- Compare rates to protocol-defined thresholds
- Indicate which thresholds were met/exceeded
- Note any safety signals requiring attention

### 3. Comparative Safety Assessment (1-2 paragraphs)
- Compare to published literature benchmarks
- Compare to international registry norms
- State whether safety profile is consistent with known risks

### 4. Safety Conclusions (1 paragraph)
- Summarize the benefit-risk assessment
- State whether the device demonstrates an acceptable safety profile
- Note any recommendations for ongoing surveillance

## Critical Requirements

- Use ONLY data provided above
- Every rate, count, and comparison must be from provided data
- Do NOT invent adverse events not mentioned
- Use formal regulatory language (e.g., "The incidence of..." not "There were...")
- Include confidence intervals where provided
- Reference source data provenance

## Output Format

Write in formal regulatory documentation style. Use paragraph structure with clear topic sentences.
Each major claim should reference its data source.
