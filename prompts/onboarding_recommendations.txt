## GUIDELINES

Be specific about the VALUE each data source brings. Focus on:
1. Actionable intelligence, not just data collection
2. Specific numbers (patients, procedures, publications)
3. Real insight capabilities tied to business needs
4. Clear connection between data sources and enabled modules
5. Realistic report page counts and descriptions
