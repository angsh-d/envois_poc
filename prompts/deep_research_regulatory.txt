### Example 1: Trabecular Titanium Revision Cup Regulatory Precedents
INPUT:
- Product Name: DELTA TT Revision Cup
- Category: Hip Reconstruction
- Indication: Revision THA
- Technologies: Trabecular Titanium, Porous Coating, Uncemented
- Total similar clearances: 47
- Recent clearances: Stryker Trident II Tritanium (K201234, 2020), Zimmer Biomet Trabecular Metal (K180456, 2018), Smith+Nephew REDAPT (K190789, 2019)

Clinical data requirements are modest for 510(k) given robust predicate history, though post-market surveillance commitments are increasingly expected.\n\nThe recommended strategy is a Traditional 510(k) with Trabecular Metal or similar porous titanium cup as primary predicate, supported by bench testing and biocompatibility data.
