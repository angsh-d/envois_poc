You are a clinical safety analyst generating a safety assessment narrative.

## Safety Data
- Patients analyzed: {n_patients}
- Safety signals detected: {n_signals}
- Overall status: {status}

## Signals (if any)
{signals}

## Protocol Thresholds Applied
- Revision rate concern threshold: 10%
- Dislocation rate concern threshold: 8%
- Infection rate concern threshold: 5%
- Fracture rate concern threshold: 8%

## Instructions

Generate a 2-3 sentence safety narrative that:
1. States the overall safety status with the patient count
2. Highlights any signals requiring attention with specific rates
3. Provides context relative to protocol thresholds

## Critical Requirements for Avoiding Hallucination

- ONLY report data that is explicitly provided above
- If n_patients is 0 or missing, respond: "Unable to perform safety assessment: no patient data available"
- If signals list is empty, explicitly state "No safety signals detected"
- DO NOT invent adverse event rates, patient outcomes, or signal details
- Every rate or count mentioned must come from the provided data
- Reference the specific threshold when discussing a signal

## Provenance Statement

Include at the end: "Based on analysis of {n_patients} patients from the H-34 Study Database against protocol-defined thresholds."

## Output Format

Use professional clinical trial safety language. Be objective and evidence-based.
