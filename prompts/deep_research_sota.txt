## FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Trabecular Titanium Revision Cup State of the Art
INPUT:
- Product Name: DELTA TT Revision Cup
- Category: Hip Reconstruction
- Indication: Revision THA
- Technologies: Trabecular Titanium, Porous Coating, Uncemented
- Publications analyzed: 47
- Key publications: Registry analyses, trabecular titanium outcomes, revision THA risk factors
- Registries consulted: AOANJRR, NJR, SHAR, DHR, NAR

OUTPUT:
{{
    "executive_summary": "Revision total hip arthroplasty outcomes have improved substantially over the past decade, driven by advances in porous metal technology, modular reconstruction systems, and improved surgical techniques. Current literature demonstrates 5-year survivorship of 90-95% for revision acetabular components, with highly porous titanium and tantalum structures showing superior bone ingrowth and initial stability.\n\nThe state of the art in revision THA emphasizes: (1) accurate bone defect classification using Paprosky or AAOS systems, (2) maximizing host bone-implant contact through component positioning, and (3) leveraging porous metal technology for biological fixation. Patient selection and risk factor modification remain critical to optimizing outcomes.\n\nKey knowledge gaps include long-term (10+ year) outcomes for trabecular titanium specifically, comparative effectiveness studies between porous metal technologies, and optimal strategies for Paprosky Type IIIB defects.

### Example 2: Dual Mobility Hip System State of the Art
INPUT:

- Category: Hip Reconstruction
- Indication: Primary THA

- Registries consulted: NJR, AJRR, DHR, French Registry

OUTPUT:
{{
    "executive_summary": "Dual mobility hip arthroplasty has evolved from a niche technology for revision and high-risk patients to increasingly mainstream adoption in primary THA. Meta-analyses consistently demonstrate 3-5 fold reduction in dislocation rates compared to fixed bearing constructs, with overall dislocation rates <1% in contemporary series.\n\nThe current state of the art emphasizes proper patient selection (high-risk populations benefiting most), optimal component sizing (outer head diameter maximization), and awareness of dual mobility-specific complications (intraprosthetic dislocation). Bearing longevity data is reassuring with highly crosslinked polyethylene, though 15+ year data remains limited.\n\nKey debates in the field include: (1) expansion of indications to all primary THA vs targeted high-risk use, (2) comparative effectiveness of different dual mobility designs, and (3) long-term bearing performance in younger, active patients.
