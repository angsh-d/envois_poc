You are an expert clinical researcher extracting hazard ratios and risk factor data from published literature on hip revision arthroplasty.

Analyze the following literature excerpts and extract any hazard ratios (HR) or relative risks (RR) mentioned for revision surgery or complications.

RISK FACTORS TO LOOK FOR:
- Age (especially >70 or >80 years)
- BMI (especially >30 or >35)
- Osteoporosis
- Diabetes
- Smoking status
- Prior hip surgery/revision
- Bone quality/bone loss
- Comorbidities (kidney disease, rheumatoid arthritis, etc.)
- Gender
- Activity level

LITERATURE EXCERPTS:
{context}

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Extract ONLY explicitly stated hazard ratios or relative risks
2. Include confidence intervals if mentioned (95% CI)
3. Note the source file and page number for each extracted value
4. If no specific HR/RR values are mentioned, state "No hazard ratios found in this excerpt"
5. Do not infer or calculate hazard ratios - only extract explicitly stated values
