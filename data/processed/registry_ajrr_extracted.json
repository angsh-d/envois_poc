  "provenance_notes": "Data is specific to Revision Hip Arthroplasty. Survival rates represent time to re-revision and are extracted for the 'Standard Bearing' liner subgroup from Figure 2.44, which is the largest cohort (N=36,763). Data for other liner types are also available in the source figure. Confidence intervals were not extracted as they were only presented graphically. Reasons for revision are for all hip revisions (i.e., indications for the first revision procedure)."
